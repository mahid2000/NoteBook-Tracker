CS1811 : OOP 1 Assignment 1

Learning Outcomes Assessed
This assignment tests your ability to write a complete Java program, using the control flow constructs described in the lectures. That is,sequencing,
branching,
loops,
method calls.


You will write a program that interacts with the user via a Scanner and performs some simple calculations.

Goal
Your friend is a PhD student studying biology at RHUL. Like all biologists, she keeps a log of her experiments in her lab notebook. The lab is shared amongst all PhD students, and there are often several experiments going on at one time. Access to the lab is controlled by swipe card. Researchers, cleaners, contractors, and other staff must swipe both in and out of the lab.

Because all researchers use standard issue notebooks, it is not uncommon for mix ups to occur and for notebooks to go missing. Your friend is frequently receiving mass emails asking everyone to check if they’ve picked up the wrong notebook by mistake.

Because all movement in and out of the lab is tracked by the swipe card system, your friend has an idea for a better system. She would like a system where researchers can enter the times they were in the lab, and be given a list of other researchers who were using the lab at the same time. Then they can contact only the relevant staff members, and reduce the amount of mass emails occurring.

Because she knows that you are getting good at coding, she asks you if you can implement this system for her.

Programming the full system will be complicated. For now, we will only implement a proof of concept program. That is, a program that implements part of the functionality (looking who was in the lab when the notebook was lost), but not the full functionality. E.g. we won’t fetch log data from the security system, we will just type it in manually for now.
